Absolutely love this product!,"I suffer with dry sensitive skin and vaseline is one of very few products that doesn't make my skin flare up and itch like crazy!The first thing I noticed was the beautiful fresh smell that escaped as I lifted the cap, as I applied a drop to my skin I instantly felt a soothing relief and easily moisturised into my skin absorbing effortlessly and not at all greasy unlike alot of other moisturisers I've tried!

2019-01-28,5,Skin so soft.. highly recommend!,So prior to receiving this I had pretty rough elbows in particular and my skin feels dry. As a busy mum of two I admit I sometimes neglect myself.. some of you may empathise! But this product trial gave me the perfect opportunity to reconnect with myself and have a bit of \u201Cme time\u201D. So for 3 days after my baths / shower I smothered myself with this. I must admit the first time I put this on I wasn\u2019t sure about the smell. It\u2019s not offensive it\u2019s like a cucumber smell (although it\u2019s aloe) but I tend to smell of perfumes all the time.. however by day 3 I actually liked the smell. Application: it went on nicely not too thick and soaked in pretty quickly it didn\u2019t feel sticky. I always have my morning wash by 07:30 but even in the evening before bedtime my skin is feeling noticibly softer and my rough elbows gone. Verdict: thumbs up. Yes I will be continuing to use this thank you for a fab product trial and for introducing me to Vaseline Aloe! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],False

2019-01-02,5,Best Make-up remover product,"Have used a lot of make-up brands and in the past bought their more expensive make-up remover products, but none have ever removed mascara, eye-shadow, foundation bases etc as gently and as well as Simple Cleansing Lotion. Its consistency is not runny, you have to squeeze the bottle appropriately onto the cotton wool, which is ideal for controlling how much is dispensed. Also great for tidying up eyeliner or mascara errors when applied sparsely on a cotton wool bud. Always keep this now in my bathroom cabinet. Why pay more?",False

2019-01-03,5,Good if you have sensitive skin,"This is a good deodorant if you have easily irritated skin. It's like Dove soap in that it doesn't seem to irritate or dry out skin. I've used Dove soaps for quite a long time and this is certainly something which they are good for, this seems to be as good as all of them. It's main selling point, beyond being an effective 24 hour deodorant, is that it is not prone to marking your clothes. It certainly seems to work as far as that goes too, though we haven't been able to test on every single colour. Good though. Recommended.",False

2019-01-06,4,A good product,The cream is very easy to apply and feels extremly cooling. It doesnt dry with any kind of sticky feeling to it.

2019-01-05,4,"Smooth, clear skin","This cream is light, odourless and leaves the skin feeling genuinely smooth, supple and refreshed. I use it as part of my nightly routine - applying it when going to bed after washing and drying my face. It is light enough not to clog the pores or feel sticky on the face, and in the morning my face always feels smooth and replenished. I have also tried using this cream during the daytime and, while it has all the benefits described above, it\u2019s not long-lasting enough in terms of the hydration it gives, meaning you often feel the need to reapply after a few hours. All in all a great overnight moisturiser if you have sensitive skin - it\u2019s unscented and it\u2019s really gentle on sore patches. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",False

2019-01-05,5,A perfect winter drink,"We all crave things that transport us back to more innocent times. For me Bovril is one of those things, from the gooey unctuousness of the tar black bovril overflowing from the spoon to the ""ding ding ding"" as I stir it in hot water to make it dissolve and the earthy, beefy smell with hints of celery and goodness knows what else. Sometimes you can get alcohol fatigue so Bovril is a great alternative to a nightcap or even mug of tea. I even go so far as to dissolve a pat of butter in it too for extra richness and within an hour I'm pretty much knocked out and sleep soundly until morning, warm and comforted. This pack will last me a long time I am sure, certainly 2 winters.",True

The smell is quite strange - it smells like cucumber in the bottle, but almost like tea on the skin. It is quite gentle on the skin, but ultimately I\u2019d say it\u2019s pretty average.

[This review was collected as part of a promotion.],False
2019-01-27,4,A good shower gel for sensitive skin,"I've bought this shower gel a few times whenever my skin is sensitive or reacting to another product.

2019-01-25,5,Fresh smell,From the simple range so not full of nasties and kind to my skin. This shower gel is refreshing and has a light cucumber smell.

2019-02-01,2,A bit too simple for me,I thought I would give this shower gel a whirl as always looking to try out new ones. Friend had said it had been good for their skin so thought I would give it a whirl The scent is hardly there at all. It doesn\u2019t last like I expected and as such doesn\u2019t allow me to feel like I\u2019m using anything I prefer when the scent lasts through the day as others do That being said it serves it purpose as a soap but I would not buy it again unless there were many other options not available [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],False
2019-01-31,5,I love this!,So I tend to use another soap free brand and I ended up trying this and it\u2019s so great. I suffer from reactions from soaps and dry skin and this is great but also I personally would probably use it on a baby\u2019s skin too. It also is fragrance free.

This shower cream is one of the few big brands which does not contain SLS, a harmful skin irritant added as a foaming agent to create a lather. It is silky smooth, thick and creamy, gentle on the skin, and rich enough to moisturise my dry mature skin. It has a gorgeous delicate fragrance and feels far more expensive than it is. Excellent value, especially for a product which contains no Sodium Laureth Sulfate, Sodium Lauryl Sulfate or Parabens.",False
2019-01-30,3,shame about the bottle!,"The mayonnaise would get 5 stars from me for taste but the container is style over substance. The squeezy bottle is, in itself, a genius idea but thats where it stops. It is too tall for the size of cap making it top heavy and unstable. Every bottle Ive ever put in my fridge has tumbled out. The cap is made of brittle plastic so it shatters as it hits the kitchen floor. Its like Groundhog Day each time it happens! Then, as other reviewers have commented, its impossible to get all the product out of the bottle. Surely this container is crying out for a design overhaul?",False
2019-01-24,5,yummy ice cream,This ice cream is great. The cookie dough pieces are just the right size and the ice cream itself is so creamy and delicious. The only problem is that once you open the tub it's impossible to stop eating until it's all gone.,False

2019-01-25,3,Decent regular lotion,"This is a decent everyday lotion with a clean light scent.

2019-01-26,5,Easily absorbed and smells great,This lightly fragranced lotion dispenses easily from the bottle. I found it spread well across my skin and was absorbed quite quickly. It really seemed to work well on my dryer areas such as knees and elbows so I tried it on my feet also!

This Simple Face Moisturiser moisturiser is fantastic. It has very little smell. It has a gel like consistency without the stickiness or gloopiness of some other products that are on the market. The moisturiser applies well to the skin and sinks in quickly leaving my skin feeling refreshed and moisturised with no heaviness or stickiness. I had no reaction to this moisturiser at all. I have a combination skin and this moisturiser was ideal as it has no greasiness. After a few hours of wearing I find that my skin feels totally normal, there is no greasiness at all which I sometimes get with creamy moisturisers. Also I found that I could apply makeup easily within a short period of time as the moisturiser sunk into my skin easily. I have light wrinkles and although the moisturiser can not perform miracles it did prevent my skin from drying over the day from the effects of heating or the sun. I think that this is one of the best moisturisers that I have used. It does the job with no side effects.",False

2019-01-28,5,Best moisturiser I ever used!,I have used mosturier in the past where it caused breakouts but with this moisturiser it does its job. It hydrates my dry skin and there were no breakouts. I highly doubt I'll ever switch to another product again.,False
2019-01-28,5,good product,"I liked this product, it makes skin so soft and skin smells fresh. It is not greasy and absorbs very quickly, making your skin very soft and comfortable. First i thought it smells a little bit strong, but then i thought no it is ok. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",False
2019-01-28,5,An all round champion,This is one product that I think every household should have in their cabinet. I have patchy skin and this soothes all of them leaving my skin refreshed and non-greasy. I even use it on my face. And it also last forever!!! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],False
2019-01-28,5,Lovely scent and does the job,"I suffer from really dry skin in the winter months and despite putting on layers and layers of my usual moisturizer, I only needed one layer within this lotion to keep me moisturized the whole day. It's texture is not very thick which worried me at first but don't let that fool you as it's ingredients work a treat in keeping moisture locked in. Lovely smell too! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",False
2019-01-28,5,Soothing and moisturising,This time of year my skin tends to become dry and itchy. Within just a few days of using Vaseline Intensive Care aloe soothe my skin feels so much better. It has a really light finish that easily absorbs into your skin without leaving a sticky feeling. It also smells really pleasant but subtle and is non greasy. It definitely delivers what it claims in terms of calming and healing dry skin. I would highly recommend [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],False
2019-01-28,4,Lovely,"I struggle with finding a moisturiser which lasts all day without me getting mid way through the day and feeling my legs are itchy and dry. I've always been willing to pay a fair bit if I find the right product. This one ticks the box as it's not expensive and is a really great cream, I don't feel the need to reapply. Great find for a moisturers, I will be buying again. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",False
2019-01-28,4,Smells lovely,"I tried this lotion and firstly couldn't get enough of the smell. It smells so clean and fresh. It's quite a light formula, and absorbs easily. It's lightweight, but moisturisers well. You can get dressed straight away. It would be great on holiday, as it's so light. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",False
2019-01-28,5,Skin so soft.. highly recommend!,So prior to receiving this I had pretty rough elbows in particular and my skin feels dry. As a busy mum of two I admit I sometimes neglect myself.. some of you may empathise! But this product trial gave me the perfect opportunity to reconnect with myself and have a bit of \u201Cme time\u201D. So for 3 days after my baths / shower I smothered myself with this. I must admit the first time I put this on I wasn't sure about the smell. It's not offensive it's like a cucumber smell (although it's aloe) but I tend to smell of perfumes all the time.. however by day 3 I actually liked the smell. Application: it went on nicely not too thick and soaked in pretty quickly it didn't feel sticky. I always have my morning wash by 07:30 but even in the evening before bedtime my skin is feeling noticibly softer and my rough elbows gone. Verdict: thumbs up. Yes I will be continuing to use this thank you for a fab product trial and for introducing me to Vaseline Aloe! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.],False

I only looked on Amazon as my supermarket had not had any for 3 weeks in a row, and realised it costs about the same here on Amazon Pantry. I wash my silk, wool and linen items on a silk wash ( on my washing machine that is a setting, but I think it comes to the following...30 degrees C, light action, very low spin cycle - very important not to hard spin wool or silk, ruins the fibres) I hang them up to dry. all of these items are either hand wash only or dry clean only items, and quite honestly I do not have the strength to hand wash or the wish to dry clean.

2019-02-04,4,"Light, non greasy and super moisturising.","Winter is really taking its toll on my skin and this moisturiser has been wonderful. It soaks in fast, isn't greasy at all and has a really refreshing aloe scent as well. It does everything I need to and does it well. It's water based so probably not best for oily skin, but on my normal to dry it's doing great. I'm pretty sensitive too but this hasn't caused any problems. However, it also contains Palm Oil. Now, palm oil is a brilliant ingredient and does a lot of wonderful things. But at the moment, it's rarely ethically sourced and that's my only issue with this product. Unilever are a big big player and need to address this issue. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",False
2019-02-04,5,Leaves skin feeling fresh,I have tried this product and was totally impressed with how soft it left my skin. Its refreshing to the touch as well as to smell.

2019-02-04,4,Soft skin,I tried the Simple hydrating cleansing wipes during the evening to remove my makeup and cleanoses the skin.

The children both loved it of course (and gave it a million stars out of 5) and particularly enjoyed counting how many chocolate fish they found.

2019-02-05,2,Formula change :(,"I've been using this moisturiser daily for 5+ years and it's always been great for the price. However a recent formula change means that it now stings slightly to apply, and has caused dermatitis to flare up around my eyes. I've compared the ingredients from before and think it's possibly due to the inclusion of 2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1,3-diol. Dissapoiting as was always super reliable before, even for my picky skin. Hopefully they'll change the formula back otherwise I won't be buying it again",False

2019-02-07,5,Really good for sensitive skin,"As a regular user of a number of simple products, I was very impressed with there refreshing shower gel. I suffer with quite dry skin during the winter, and when using other brands of shower gel they can sometimes act harshly and leave my skin quite dry and flaky, especially on my face. However with this simple shower gel this is not the case. It does not irritate my skin in face it leaves my complexion looking clearer and my skin feeling soft. The size of the bottle is adequate for everyday use and regular use. And although the packaging is quite mild it does the job. I would definitely choose this shower gel out of the choice. A little bit goes a long way, and the product has a pleasent scent. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",False

While you might think a refreshing shower gel is quite ""liquid"" in its form, you could feel the cucumber extrat, which i found great! Often, products say things on their bottle and don't truly mean it whereas the Simple Product was not one of them. Secondly, the smell is amazing and my skin has not badly acted upon it. I do think it is a good product but it might not please others as well! [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",False

2019-02-17,5,Great product but watch the price,Used this conditioner for years! Others often comment when taking washing out how nice it smells..but does not leave lingering fragrance like a perfume.

As always Amazon has price fluctuation for many different reasons but this particulr item ranges from £5 to £10. Watch the price!! Can easily buy for £6 in shops when in stock. I never buy when costs more here.,True

I've used previous wipes in the past like baby wipes and they seem easier to wipe makeup off. Packaging is beautiful not going to lie. They are useful to get makeup off your hands or your eyes but with foundation just gotta scrub more. Would be nice with a smell, I know they say no artificial perfume but something else would be nice. It states that the wipes dont contain alcohol however, on the back in small writing I see that it says it uses Cetearyl alcohol which is still a form of alcohol.

2019-02-19,4,Refreshing and effective,"I tried these on a fairly dry swatch of quite concealer on my hand, and it took all but a faint stain off which was quite impressive for a face wipe. On my face they feel refreshing, cool and leave the slightest tingle of 'clean' behind. You can see on the wipe that they're taking off the yuck of the day, along with any makeup (yes, including most of my mascara). I might have put more wipes in the pack- enough for a month of one a day, but that's probably my main niggle. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",False

2019-02-19,4,Seems useful,"Simple Micellar wipes limited addition (little mix) -The wipes seem alright to use however, not that easy. I've used previous wipes in the past like baby wipes and they seem easier to wipe makeup off. Packaging is beautiful not going to lie. They are useful to get makeup off your hands or your eyes but with foundation just gotta scrub more. Would be nice with a smell, I know they say no artificial perfume but something else would be nice. It states that the wipes dont contain alcohol however, on the back in small writing I see that it says it uses Cetearyl alcohol which is still a form of alcohol. Apart from that, I would use them if I needed too and reccomend the product as an okay product to buy. [This review was collected as part of a promotion.]",False

Thankfully, this one doesn't. My skin is more glowy and it definitely feels more hydrated and smooth since I started using this a few months ago.

2019-03-05,5,Extremely good value Persil washing capsules,"Some things in life are enjoyable to buy and some things plainly are not. No matter how pretty the product and how bright and bold the actual washing detergent is, it will always be a grudge purchase. No one likes to have dirty smelly clothes and wash powder / tablets / capsules are a necessity that makes a hole in everyone's weekly grocery budget that could be better spent on something interesting such as cakes or exotic vegetables that you have to look up how to cook. Along with Ariel, Fairy and Bold, Persil is one of the big brands that dominant the market for detergents. It is owned by global consumer products giant Unilever who are experts at branding and marketing. It is refreshing to see these capsules at such reasonable value., they work out 15p each which is an absolute bargain.

It is easily absorbed , doesn't leave greasy skin so is great under make up. Can be used with day or night eye creams. Best of all it's a good price.",False

2019-03-15,4,Great but extortionate price,"Helped my scalp so much but the price is ridiculous when you consider the amount you have to use per wash and that you must buy the conditioner too. Any other non gentle brand would last me 4 times longer than this. It feels like people with illness are being rinsed (no pun intended). It's a no go for really long hair. I will be looking into other cheaper alternatives but the product is great. It's helped with my husbands dermatitis and with my sore scalp. At first my hair went dry and was like hay, then it was switching back and forth from dry to greasy but after a few weeks it's looking healthier than ever. I'm wondering if it just takes time for your hair to get used to less stuff on it and to get back to more of its natural form if you know what I mean.My main advice would be to try it for 6 weeks minimum before you write it off as rubbish.My only other annoyance aside from the price is that it's very thin and runny. It's hard to stop it running down my hair then off down my back so 20% of the bottle just goes down the plug hole without ever washing my hair first.",False

Just don't go sniffing directly from the bottle as it's concentrated, the scent is much more intense that it really is. The ultra concentrated allows for a much smaller bottle and you don't need to use as much in the washing machine either (just half a lid worth); the smaller bottle of course makes the carbon footprint smaller; in addition, the bottle is made from 100% recycled plastic which is a bonus, and both the bottle and lid can be recycled back. Only downside is the sleeve isn't, so do make sure you remove this before throwing the bottle in the recycling; hopefully they will work on making the whole thing recyclable in the future. All in all, good value for money and great scent (though the latter is subjective).",False

The fragrance is strong and the consistency of the conditioner is reasonably thick.I now use half as much as I previously used. One third to half a cap is quite enough for a full wash load to soften and produce amazing scent. And softens clothes admirably. We don't need an overpowering blast of perfume, a subtle whiff is lovely. By using less, we are doing our small bit to save the planet through pollution.

2019-04-24,5,Great for sensitive skin,"My wife has extremely sensitive skin, which I never believed until I inadvertently washed some of her clothing in a different detergent. On that basis, she has used either Persil or Fairy products for our joint laundry for many years. Combine that with the fact that we cannot use biological products as we have a septic tank, this product is ideal. The detergent is dispensed into a capsule which is inserted into the main body of the product and then placed on top of the laundry. There is sufficient detergent for 48 washes from the two bottles. The detergent is complimented by a fabric conditioner, which is measured out into the fabric compartment softener on the washing machine; there is sufficient to condition 24 washes. Both products have a pleasant ""clean"" fragrance and leave clothing smelling fresh and soft after drying. A really good product for those with sensitive skin and competitively priced against normal supermarket prices.",False

2019-04-26,4,Persil and Comfort Sensitive Kit,"In this ""kit"" for sensitive skin you get x2 Persil non-biological washing detergent (potentially 48 washes) and x1 ultra-concentrate Comfort Pure (potentially 38 washes). I say potentially because if you are doing larger loads you'll need to increase the amount you use. We tend to alternate between Fairy and Persil non-bio, not only because we have young children but also because some family members have sensitive skin. We've never had an issue with someone having a reaction due to Persil, it's probably our preferred brand. We don't use Comfort Pure all the time because some members of the family don't like how it leaves their clothes feeling (too soft!), but we do use it on the children's clothes because it leaves them nice and soft. Both products in this kit are endorsed by the British Skin Foundation. Price for the kit at the time of writing the review is £11, this is slightly more than you would currently get the individual products in some supermarkets (£3 for each product). But you are getting them delivered too. If you wanted to give a practical baby shower gift, this would be ideal, slightly different to a nappy pyramid. Would also make a practical house-warming present. Overall - good products that work, slightly on the expensive side.",False

Thought I would try this instead of my usual St.Tropez Gradual Tan the one you use in the shower. Well I am so glad I did as it not only gave me natural tan but also had a slight shimmer to it which made my legs look a lot healthier considering I am over 60 and it does not have that awful smell either like other fake tans.

The first time i put it on my arms all over sparingly i didnt really notice that much although there was definately something. Today i thought let me add a bit more after a my usual morning shower. I applied a bit more liberally over arms legs, and face. I have had comments today on what a lovely glow i have. It has developed nicely today. I have a sassy looking healthy bod and i feel good. Bought another tube and just ordered a few more whilst on offer. I hate sitting in the sun and burning (unless i am covered in P20 lotion) and this is a very safe way to get the bronze look.

2019-04-23,4,Follow the pouring instructions and you are on a winner!,"Great fragrance that strikes just the right balance - although the wife complains that the small bottles are very difficult to pour accurately from. They probably are if you slurp in what you reckon is a full measure and, in fact, it is nearer two full measures. This is a really quick way to use up a small 540 ml bottle….but….if you use the cap as a measure as it is supposed to be…..then you will find it is a very economical way to use the conditioner! Very cool fragrance which actually carries through to your clothes, making you smell like a Fresh Sky – if you know what such a thing smells like? Something else I really like about this conditioner is that the bottles are all made from recyclable plastic and the manufacturer is asking for customers to recycle the new bottles so they can go the same path third time around! Three Stars for the product and another one for being good and green.",False
2019-04-23,4,"Economical, softens clothes, not as good as dedicated fragrancers if you want a lasting scent","Great price for these bottles, and you only need a small amount (half a cap) in the wash to soften clothes. The smell is nice but doesn't last - if you want something that lingers, try Lenor Unstoppables (but that won't soften clothes). That said, the softening effect is noticeable, even when handwashing delicate underwear. I like the ultra concentration which reduces the size of the bottles for storage.",False
2019-04-23,5,Convenient and effective fabric conditioner,This is an ultra concentrated fabric conditioner. I was initially surprised at how small the bottles were but then I read on the side that you only need half a cap of the product so each bottle will last you a while. It is nice to be able to fit the bottles in my kitchen cupboard! I did find that half a cap was enough. I live in an area with very hard water and my clothes came out of the wash feeling soft and smelling lovely. I did really like the scent although it is nothing special (it just had that generic floral fabric conditioner scent that they all have).,False

2019-04-24,5,Comfort Intense Laundry Conditioner Liquid (Fresh Sky),"Our household normally use comfort, however I hadn't used the 'Fresh Sky' scent before, which I must say is really nice! Just don't go sniffing directly from the bottle as it's concentrated, the scent is much more intense that it really is. The ultra concentrated allows for a much smaller bottle and you don't need to use as much in the washing machine either (just half a lid worth); the smaller bottle of course makes the carbon footprint smaller; in addition, the bottle is made from 100% recycled plastic which is a bonus, and both the bottle and lid can be recycled back. Only downside is the sleeve isn't, so do make sure you remove this before throwing the bottle in the recycling; hopefully they will work on making the whole thing recyclable in the future. All in all, good value for money and great scent (though the latter is subjective).",False

2019-04-24,5,Lovely scent,"This listing is for a pack of 8, concentrated fabric softeners, although I received a sample for review purposes. Note that the container is made from 100% recycled plastic and is suitable for further recycling, but you do need to remove the plastic wrap that holds the product information (once the bottle is used up, as you need it beforehand for dosing information). I found I needed to use a jar opener to remove the lid for the first time; I guess that is good when you are receiving this via the post as it means there is less chance of the lid coming loose and spilling contents into the parcel rather than onto your clothes. I like the scent, which transfers well to laundry and leaves it smelling floral without being overly sweet. It would be worth sniffing in a shop before committing to a large pack however, as not all laundry scents are to everyone’s taste. The softness is fantastic, particularly noticeable after laundry has been dried outside, which normally makes it feel stiff. A bottle will cover up to 36 loads (4-5 Kg), you will only manage 16 larger, 6-7 Kg loads. The bottle looks small, but the liquid is very concentrated, so do use the dosing cap rather than just pour into the machine as you will otherwise use too much (probably).",False

The bottle is small as the liquid is a condensed type and this bottle is capable of 36 washes (apparently), however, I would say that to get a really fragrance you do have to use a little more than it says on the bottle....however, that may be down to my taste to be honest as I do like my laundry to be very fragrant.

As a paying customer, however, these are nothing to write home about. There's an uncomfortable flavour clash, between the dark chocolate coating and the sickly sweet raspberry sauce which covers the core, that's difficult to describe. The core itself reminded me of the cheapest imaginable insipid, own brand raspberry ice-cream with little of the smooth creaminess you find in other Magnums. It's almost as if they rushed the product development process and ended up with bitter raspberry ripple on a stick. So, so disappointing when you consider what these could have been.",False

The bottles are reasonably good value as a little goes a long way - A half capful is recommended for washes of 4-5 kg, and a full capful for larger washes.

The product is highly concentrated, so comes in a smaller bottle that is itself recycled. Reduced packaging and transport costs. All very commendable. Just how concentrated the product is can be sensed from the fact that you can detect the scent before you even open the bottle. When you do, don't breath deeply (as I did), it's overpowering. However, in it's more dilute form (just half a cap per load), it does add a pleasant, slightly zesty aroma to your clothes. The scent will be a matter of taste, but we like it and our washing feels soft and pleasant (though we were already regular Comfort users). In this form the product represents good value for a quality product and for those who want to lessen their impact on the environment (albeit in the smallest of ways), there's something for you here, too.",False

This probably explains why there is so much said on the label explaining that a little goes a long way with this product. I have the fuchsia perfume version which smells OK and isn't overpowering. This is a big plus for me as I have had difficulty with the intensely perfumed products in the past.

Ever since I had small babies and now helping with grandchildren, this is the most child-friendly of all the branded washing products. Recommended by the Skin Foundation means you can try any eczema-afflicted skin with this item with confidence. Having the smaller, ultra concentrated Pure Comfort as an extra means you can dish up an extra helping of softness when required. Just a little amount will do the job. Altogether 48 washes from the two handy bottles of Persil's Non-Bio liquid detergent can be carefully measured into the bubble pod, so no waste. In our soft water area, the lesser amount can be used. Yes, it still sorts out everyday stains, no worries there. The scent is fresh and clean, the whole house smells lovely when the laundry is on the go, being aired and ironed.",False

2019-05-24,5,It's a fabric conditioner not a game changer.,"The hype attached to the scent of fabric conditioner is something as a family we ignore. All we want is for the clothes to smell fresh and pleasant after a wash, to be soft and comfortable to wear and for the product to be economical. Fortunately, this one fulfills all the criteria. When I say 'to smell fresh and pleasant' I don't mean stink the place out with the scent and overpower and wilt everything in a 100 yard radius. Again, fortunately, this doesn't do so and so gets a general thumbs up, but I could have done without the wording bigging up the wonderfulness of the smells.

The bundled pack is a practical suggestion that offers good value compared to the individual retail prices of 2x25 wash Persil and 1x38 wash Comfort, making the fabric softener effectively free. I can't remember not using Persil non-biological as my laundry detergent of choice, it's the brand I grew up with - one that doesn't irritate the eczema and allergy prone skin of several members of my family. It has a pleasant, but not overly dominant scent, and the fluid formulation means this can be used even on cold washes. The Comfort is a highly concentrated version in quite a small bottle. In real life, the bottle is rather smaller than the product photo makes it appear in relation to the Persil, but this doesn't represent poor value (38 washes worth is 38 washes worth regardless of the size container in which it comes) and the small size does a good job of keeping the use of packaging materials down.",False

2019-05-09,5,I'm returning to the Persil non-bio fold.,"I used Persil non-bio for many years, but changed to a brand specifically for babies about eight years ago, so it was a bit of a homecoming using it again. I really like the flip-top opening and how smoothly the product pours into the dispenser ball, which is much easier than the crosscut design on my usual brand that requires a fair amount of pressure. I never had a problem with how well Persil cleans, and this hasn’t changed; a machine load of baby clothes – together with stains - muslins and bedding came out spotless. With the addition of the Comfort Pure conditioner, the laundry was very soft and smelled lovely. It also performs well on general washing. I have decided to go back to using Persil non-bio; not just for the frustration-free dispenser, but it performs so well and is kind to skin. Using it again has made me wonder why I ever left the brand in the first place.",False

I use this along with the matching Scent Pearls. Use half a capful of this along with your normal detergent then once dried you have this incredible dreamy scent that really lasts, you can smell it subtly when you open your wardrobe, it's lovely. This bumper box is a good way to buy in bulk or go to your supermaket and look out for special offers! Highly recommended, this is the best conditioner we've tried!",False

These two non-biological products are dermatologically tested and endorsed by the British Skin Foundation – they have been developed especially to be kind to sensitive baby skin.

Okay, you have to buy a box of it, but, if you have enough storage space, it's the way to go. It has a pleasant scent and it's a good size, though in this house we've been used to bigger bottles. The claim is it has 36 washes per bottle but that's using the recommended 1/2 cap, but I have to admit we've been using slightly more than that. Okay, that own label stuff will be cheaper and does come in a larger size but you do tend to have to use a bit more each wash.",False
2019-04-29,3,Lovely and lasting scent.,Bulk buying this Intense version of this seems the only way to get true value for money unless you spot a deal. If you follow the on the bottle instructions the half a cap measure is enough to get the job done properly. The scent is lovely and really seems to last well even after some time after washing. Pleased overall just would probably get standard Comfort as a default and this as an on offer treat. Perhaps even better as the bigger bottles to get more for your money.,False

Value for money this is an excellent product definitely better and cheaper brands some of which just don’t work or smell very harsh .,False

2019-05-03,5,Concentrated Flowers,"Clearly this latest product variation from Comfort is to address some environmental concerns and plastics waste. The product is highly concentrated, so comes in a smaller bottle that is itself recycled. Reduced packaging and transport costs. All very commendable. Just how concentrated the product is can be sensed from the fact that you can detect the scent before you even open the bottle. When you do, don't breath deeply (as I did), it's overpowering. However, in it's more dilute form (just half a cap per load), it does add a pleasant, attractively ""flowery"" aroma to your clothes. All scents will be a matter of taste, but we like it and our washing feels soft and pleasant (though we were already regular Comfort users). In this form the product represents good value for a quality product and for those who want to lessen their impact on the environment (albeit in the smallest of ways), there's something for you here, too.",False

Thankfully it's not like that at all and the scent it leaves is fresh and quite subtle (once dry) and lingers around without being too pervasive. The Fresh Sky fragrance is appealing and not too chemical-like with a fruity/floral mix. For me, it suits household items more than clothes, things like towels and bed linen are left softened and fresh-smelling. I appreciate the small bottle size and concentrated liquid and that it has less environmental impact but I do think that the concentrated liquids are less effective at softening than the more dilute liquids are. If you're looking for the best softening then consider a full-sized bottle but if you prefer a more subtle softening effect but the same fresh fragrance then this concentrated version is a great buy.",False

The bottles - 6 of them, and not 8 as the ad states, come in a compact box and tbh, that itself could be used to deliver the products in, rather than having that placed in an Amazon box with more paper wrapping. All of the packaging, including the empty bottles, can be recycled. You don't waste any of the liquid, as the top of the bottle is well designed to minimise spillage and so that you can pour just what you need (half a capful is recommended, but I went with a little more), and not a gush of liquid from a large spout. I've had to dry indoors today due to the weather, and my whole house smells of this. I'm really impressed with this, and even for 6 bottles rather than the stated 8, this is good value for money. I also like that the small bottles mean that I can store them on a lower shelf for heavier items, rather than risking my under-sink shelving collapsing (yes, it's happened more than once!). Just don't squeeze the bottles hard, as they're made from recycled plastic and are a little flimsy-feeling.",False

2019-05-13,5,Good value,"This is a more traditional scent from fabric conditioning experts Comfort. This 8 pack is highly concentrated, so you don't need to place much in the conditioner tray for it to be effective. The bottle is made from recycled plastic and itself can be recycled. A nice set of 8 bottles.",False
2019-05-06,5,Nice fresh smell,"Comfort Intense has a nice fresh fragrance, although don't use more than recommended as it can be quite strong. The bottle is a nice size, easy for storing in a cupboard and although it looks small, you get a lot of washes out of the bottle. It does leave fabrics softer and is good for using with stuff you wash regularly like towels. Highly recommended!",False
2019-04-30,4,Brings comfort to your clothes and your soul,"I love this product. It retains the quality one expects from the well known makers and leaves clothes feeling soft and smelling fresh. The concept of ultra concentrate isn't new as I recall they did one years ago in a tetra type pack. But now maybe public are ready for this innovation. The container is made from recycled plastic which is fantastic and refillable. It is also recyclable but the sleeve isn't which is a disappointment. I'm hoping the refill packs are from a more cardboard style pack though and fully recyclable. I'm glad it has a dose counter as it seems so much less to use it would be easy to put in too much if it wasn't there. My other half and I have sensitive skin and this was fine for us to use. I found it hard to read the small print on the wrapper even with magnification glass. But I couldn't see anything to say if it was tested on animals or if any animal products used in the making. Although this is not a food product these are issues that are important for many. Whilst it provides details of the headquarter offices it doesn't actually say where its produced, I think this would be helpful to know as for many people myself included would prefer to buy products made in country of sale to reduce carbon footprint. I am a little torn about this product as if it was a washing powder or liquid and comfort softener combination I can't help thinking that cuts down packaging and carbon footprint further and can be better value. However separate comfort softener such as this does make clothes smell lovely.",False

2019-05-11,4,Good Softener,"This is a multi-pack of eight bottles of fabric softener. They are not the typical large sized bottles that I am used to, which is a bonus as they are cumbersome and tricky to store. These are half the height and fit better in the storage area in my kitchen. The softener itself has a strong, but not overpowering floral smell. Clothes come out of the wash noticeably softer after use, when compared without any. As I line dry my washing, this has been a nice addition to my laundry routine.",False

2019-05-02,4,"Seems to work well regarding softness, but not much scent.","LIKES - Lots of softness. The washed clothing seems remarkably pleasant to touch and feel. - The specified quantity per wash is smaller than some other conditioners, meaning that a smaller bottle gives plenty of washes. LESS LIKED - Seems to have a rather 'light' scent, when used at the advised quantities, so if you like the scent of fabric conditioners you will get less of it.

2019-04-27,5,Perfect for eczema and sensitive skin,We use Persin non-bio washing liquid all the time. It is by far the best washing liquid for sensitive skin. I suffer from eczema and have tried all sorts of sensitive skin washing liquids / powder but Persil is without a doubt the best. Comfort adds a little bit of softens to the whole mix and makes the clothes softer thus easier to wear / removing the little bit of stiffness that can irritate very sensitive skin.,False

I have been using this scrub for years now and I don't know of any other that comes close. Price is fab.

2019-04-30,3,animal testing,It would be good to point out that Cif does test on animals. Nope for me.,False
2019-05-18,5,great substitute,"Will quite happily buy these instead of the usual Cornettos. The flavour is great, and the ice cream texture is different, but really good. The cone isn't quite as nice as classic Cornetto but still very tasty.",False
2019-05-12,5,Lovely flavour,Myself and my grandchildren love these lollies. Unfortunately we all prefer the green ones so these go first. Would be even better if they sold packets with just the lime flavour.,False
2019-05-22,5,A pleasant treat,Its been a while since I had the real thing and this is a welcome treat.,False
2019-05-24,5,Favourite shower gel,"Love this shower gel, great for sensitive skin, pleasant fragrance and lathers up nicely.",False
2019-05-15,1,Great cone. AWFUL ice cream,"Im a Coeliac and intolerant to cows milk, and have a huge sweet tooth. Ive found some amazing vegan ice cream alternatives. Ocado sell a number of delicious ones. I also LOVE Tescos gluten and dairy free Cornettos However was super excited to try these, especially after all the amazing reviews. The tops are covered in nuts and chocolate, and the cone is thick and crispy. However none of these bits are quite enough to hide the awful taste of the ice cream. I cant even describe it as bland, as it had a flavour.... just an awful one. It was not creamy and ice cream like. It was like frozen whipped up soya milk that they removed the flavour from. I enjoyed eating the chocolate and nut part and the cone, and just cringed my way through the ice cream part. Cant understand all the rave reviews. The vegan Magnums however are spot on and delicious!!!",False
2019-05-22,1,Not as good as the ultra duo,"Very dissapointed in these capsules. The previous version, which was the Ultra, with only two compartments, was great because the capsules dissolved completely without leaving traces. These leave small white trails on dark clothes.",False
2019-05-01,5,Best make up wipes,I find these wipes get my make up off easily and are far superior to other wipes for that alone,False
2019-05-19,5,"Great taste, gluten free & vegan with no palm oil","Great taste, gluten free & vegan with no palm oil. Highly recommended.",False
2019-05-05,4,It's no cookies and cream but a welcome yum treat,I was so excited to purchase this as I react to the usual dairy brands. The cone is lovely and the ice cream is nice enough to feel you are having a treat. It doesn't have the creamy feeling and texture of ice cream but near enough to eat and enjoy without any reaction! It's a little smaller than the full size cornetto but that's ok to keep the calories down. Would have liked the choc lump at the bottom of the cone. Already ordered my second box.,False
2019-04-27,5,perfect,"These are amazing, just like the original Cornetto but vegan. Im really impressed.",False
2019-05-02,5,delicious,Our whole family loves bovril and we use it daily on toast in the morning. My 2 year old loves it and always asks for it.,False
2019-05-05,1,This review is for the squeezy bottle,Contents of this bottle is lovely. HOWEVER trying to get it out of the squeezy bottle is a challenge of strength and endurance. I will buy Helmann's light mayo again but NEVER in this bottle because I don't want to risk my bones and tendons breaking trying to get the contents out of the bottle.,False
2019-05-17,4,very nice,These taste great and you cannot Cant tell they are vegan,False
2019-04-27,5,Brilliant,"Really pleased to have vegan Cornettos at last, they're very close to the dairy version and I'm not gluten intolerant but the cone is great and you wouldn't know it's gluten free so I'm happy!",False
